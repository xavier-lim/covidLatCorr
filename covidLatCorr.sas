/*INTRODUCTION*/

/*To test the hypothesis that countries further from the equator (i.e. more likely to be cold) are 
more likely to contract COVID-19, I plan to perform a correlation analysis to analyze the relationship
between a countryâ€™s latitude and their number of COVID-19 cases and deaths*/

/*After determining each country's current total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths (as of June 5), I 
will calculate each country's distance from the equator by taking the absolue value of their latitude. 
Next, I will merge the data frames to show a country's COVID-19 cases and deaths next to their absolute
latitude. I will also create macro functions to remove outliers and set which countries will be labelled 
on graphs. Finally, I will carry out the correlation analysis.*/
